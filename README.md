# TorrentX

Minimal BitTorrent CLI client written in Java. TorrentX implements the core of the BitTorrent protocol which supports magnet links and can download a single-file torrent from an HTTP tracker and a single peer, which then saves the result to your Downloads folder.

## Features

- Download files via BitTorrent protocol
- Magnet link support
- HTTP tracker announce with compact peer list
- Single peer download flow with piece pipelining
- SHAâ€‘1 verification of each piece
- Saves output to your system `Downloads` directory

## Installation

```bash
brew tap kpraveenkumar19/torrentx
brew install torrentx
```

## Usage

After installing (via Homebrew) the commands are available globally:

```bash
download <torrent_file>
magnet_download <magnet_link>
```

### `download <torrent_file>`

Downloads a single-file torrent referenced by `<torrent_file>`.

Examples:

```bash
download sample.torrent
```

Important:
- Place the `.torrent` file inside your `~/Downloads` folder. The client reads the torrent file from `Downloads` by name, e.g. `~/Downloads/sample.torrent`.
- The downloaded content will be saved to `~/Downloads/<name>` where `<name>` is taken from the torrent's `info.name`.

### `magnet_download <magnet_link>`

Downloads via a magnet link. A tracker URL must be present in the magnet (the `tr` parameter), and the infohash must be provided via `xt=urn:btih:<infohash>`.

Examples:

```bash
magnet_download "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:<infohash>&tr=https%3A%2F%2Ftracker.example.org%2Fannounce"
```

### Notes and Limitations

- Single-file torrents only (multi-file torrents are not supported)
- HTTP trackers only (no UDP tracker)
- Connects to the first peer from the tracker compact list; no peer rotation or retry strategy
- Expects the `.torrent` file to reside in `~/Downloads` and writes output there
